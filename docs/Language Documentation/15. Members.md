## Members

Members are part of values, they can either be functions or fields. They allow you to interact and use part of the values. These are usually accessed through the `.` operator, followed by the field or function name (and brackets if you are calling the function). Classes can also have members, these are known as static members, static members are not based on an object but instead on the class definition itself.
```kotlin
hello = "hElLo";
// Lowercase is a method of <String>, and
// when it gets called it returns a complete
// lowercase representation of the string
print(hello.lowercase());

// type is a static field of the String class
// this is the type that represents the class
print(String.type);
```

Usually each class has its own static members and each value has its own members too, these are documented on a separate page, and you can find that [here](https://github.com/senseiwells/Arucas/blob/main/docs/Built-in%20Classes.md).
